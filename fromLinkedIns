 got CK{AD,A,S} certified recently and here are the list of resources that worked for me. I hope it helps someone out there.

✶ CKAD:
 ➤ Course: https://lnkd.in/eiaTidDG by Mumshad Mannambeth
 ➤ Exercises: https://lnkd.in/eX_EAJa4 (useful for CKA too)
 ➤ Bookmarks: https://lnkd.in/eYbi6uBg

✶ CKA:
 ➤ Course: https://lnkd.in/e4_eH68s by Mumshad Mannambeth
 ➤ Exercises: Mumshad's labs on Udemy/KodeKloud and/or killer.sh should be good enough
 ➤ Bookmarks: https://lnkd.in/eYhXdhdw

✶ CKS:
 ➤ Course: https://lnkd.in/ePC5qRU7 by Kim Wüstkamp
 ➤ Exercises: Kim's course gives you access to simulator as well and that should be good
  ➤ Bookmarks: https://lnkd.in/eMQ_j8nV
 
Common point for all 3 certs are:
✅ Practice(a lot) with a timer and with the bookmarks. That way you know what and where to look for in the exam.
